Features-

Multi-step Loan Application Form: A user-friendly form divided into 4 steps (Personal Info, Financial Details, Loan Details, Documents)
Form Validation: Real-time input validation with clear error messages
Progress Tracking: Visual progress indicator shows users their position in the application process
Automatic Account Creation: System creates accounts for users based on their email and birth year
Secure Authentication: Firebase authentication system with appropriate error handling
User Dashboard: Shows application status and document verification status
Admin Panel: Allows administrators to view and approve loan applications
Status Notifications: Alerts users when their application is approved
Form Data Persistence: Saves form progress using localStorage

Design Decisions & Assumptions-

Authentication Simplicity: Used Firebase for authentication but simplified the login process by using birth year as part of the password for better user experience
Local Storage: Used localStorage for data persistence to eliminate the need for a backend database in this demonstration
Progressive Disclosure: Form is split into logical steps to avoid overwhelming users with too many fields at once
Status Management: Applications start as "Under Review" and can be approved by admins
Simplified Admin Access: Admin panel is accessible without special authentication for demo purposes
Mobile Responsiveness: All pages are designed to work on various screen sizes
Firebase Configuration: Assumed Firebase services are available and properly configured
